5. When is the "Hotfix" branch used in GIT Flow
+ Peter Rudolph C. Vigafria: Used to quickly address critical issues or bugs in the production environment. It is created from the 'main' branch and is used to develop the fix for the issue. Once the fix is complete, it is merged back into both the 'main' branch and the 'develop' branch to ensure that the fix is applied to the current release and future releases.
